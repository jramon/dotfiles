# Mathias’s dotfiles

This is my own fork based on Mathia's . files, I removed lot's of stuff so I can use what I need only.

Plase look how I don't have a .bashrc and my own .bash_profile in this repo only sources the dot files, that snippet can easily be added to your existing .bash_profile

Thanks Mathias 

Ramon

## Installation

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```
